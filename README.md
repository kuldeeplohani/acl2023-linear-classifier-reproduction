## Overview
This project compares traditional TF-IDF + Linear SVM models against BERT-based models for text classification on the LexGLUE benchmark.  
It includes:
- Complete code reproduction (linear + BERT)
- Result comparisons
- Analytical project report (NIT Patna, 2025)

## Structure
- `baseline.ipynb` – main notebook (linear model reproduction)
- `report/` – final academic report (PDF and DOCX)
- `data/` – LexGLUE dataset links
- `results/` – reproduced metrics and logs
