# ACL 2023 Paper Reproduction – *Linear Classifier: An Often-Forgotten Baseline for Text Classification*

### 📘 Overview

This repository contains the **reproduction and analysis** of the ACL 2023 paper:  
> **Lin, Yu-Chen; Chen, Si-An; Liu, Jie-Jyun; Lin, Chih-Jen. (2023)**  
> *Linear Classifier: An Often-Forgotten Baseline for Text Classification.*  
> *Proceedings of the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2023).*  
> [https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-short.160](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-short.160)

The goal of this project is to **reproduce the experiments**, understand the comparative performance of **linear models** and **transformer-based models (BERT)** for text classification, and analyze the **efficiency–accuracy trade-offs** in modern NLP.

## 🧭 Project Objectives

1. **Reproduce** the results of the ACL 2023 paper using the official code and datasets.  
2. **Compare** the performance of linear models (TF-IDF + SVM/Logistic Regression) with BERT models.  
3. **Analyze** computational efficiency, scalability, and interpretability.  
4. **Modify** and experiment with hyperparameters or subsets to test robustness.  
5. **Document** results and insights in a detailed academic report.
